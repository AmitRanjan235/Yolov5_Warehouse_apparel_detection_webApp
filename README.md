<h1 align="center" id="title">Apparel Detection Web App using YOLOv5</h1>

<p id="description">This web application uses the YOLOv5 deep learning model to detect apparel from an image uploaded by the user. The detected objects are then highlighted with bounding boxes and labeled with the predicted class.</p>

```

<p>3. Run the App</p>

<<<<<<< HEAD
clientApp.py: This file contains the Flask application code, including the routing and view functions.
yolov5webapp\Yolov5_apparel_detection_webApp\com_warehouse_apparel\predictor_yolo_detector\detector_test.py: This file contains the code for detecting apparel using the YOLOv5 model.
yolov5webapp\Yolov5_apparel_detection_webApp\templates\index.html: This file contains the HTML code for the web application interface.
=======
```
To run the web application run the following command:  Copy code python clientApp.py This will start the Flask development server on http://127.0.0.1:9500. You can then open this URL in your web browser to access the web application.
